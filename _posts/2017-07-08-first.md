So I have finally had enough sleep to sober down and write about my experience of organising Clash Hacks. It was three months ago when I told myself that 2017 is going to be a different year. Call it a resolution or as Guy sensei would say, a self rule or whatever you feel like but I told myself that I am going to start doing stuff rather than just talking about it this year.

I had *won 11 hackathons* and participated in about 20 of them at this point of my life and I realised that I had been talking about organising one since forever. So I decided that it is going to be the first thing I do this year. I had no experience of organising any sorts of large events, let alone a hackathon but I absolutely loved the culture and wanted to promote it here in India and thus decided to give it a [shot](http://hacksociety.tech).

The first thing I did was find a reliable team and it was easy. I asked my college squad whether they were interested in organising a hackathon and they immediately got on board. Luckily, I have an amazing friend circle and we had the right mix of tech enthusiasts, managerial people, designers and people who are just good with people.

## What we learnt ?

We had an amazing time in the last three months and I canâ€™t think of a single person in the team who has not learnt something of value during this period. 

* From getting better at development and designing to learning how to talk to people in the real world, we made sure each one of us steps out of our comfort zones to try and learn something new while contributing to the event. 

* We even organised a few sessions for students before the event on how they can get started with hackathons and development in general which was also a new experience for most of our team members and helped not only the attendees but also the team expand their skill set.
